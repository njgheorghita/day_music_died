1941,Artie Shaw,Stardust,And now the purple dusk of twilight time. Steals across the meadows of my heart High up in the sky the little stars climb. Always reminding me that we're apart. You wander down the lane and far away. Leaving me a song that will not die. Love is now the stardust of yesterday. The music of the years gone by. Sometimes I wonder why I spend. The lonely night dreaming of a song. The melody haunts my reverie. And I am once again with you. When our love was new. And each kiss an inspiration. But that was long ago. Now my consolation. Is in the stardust of a song. Beside a garden wall When stars are bright. You are in my arms. The nightingale tells his fairy tale. A paradise where roses bloom. Though I dream in vain. In my heart it will remain. My stardust melody. The memory of love's refrain.

1943,Bing Crosby,Oh What a Beautiful Mornin',There's a bright golden haze on the meadow There's a bright golden haze on the meadow The corn is as high as an elephant's eye An' it looks like its climbin' clear up to the sky. Chorus: Oh what a beautiful morning Oh what a beautiful day I've got a wonderful feeling Everything's going my way.. Repeat chorus. All the cattle are standing like statues All the cattel are standing like statues They don't turn their heads as they see me ride by. But a little brown mav'rick is winking her eye.. Repeat chorus.

1943,Rudy Vallee,As Time Goes By,This day and age we're living in Gives cause for apprehension With speed and new invention And things like fourth dimension. Yet we get a trifle weary With Mr. Einstein's theory. So we must get down to earth at times Relax relieve the tension. And no matter what the progress Or what may yet be proved The simple facts of life are such They cannot be removed.]. You must remember this A kiss is still a kiss a sigh is just a sigh. The fundamental things apply As time goes by.. And when two lovers woo They still say 'I love you.' On that you can rely No matter what the future brings As time goes by.. Moonlight and love songs Never out of date. Hearts full of passion Jealousy and hate. Woman needs man And man must have his mate That no one can deny. It's still the same old story A fight for love and glory A case of do or die. The world will always welcome lovers As time goes by.. {Musical Interlude}. It's still the same old story A fight for love and glory A case of do or die. The world will always welcome lovers As time goes by. 
1944,Bing Crosby,Swinging On A Star,Would you like to swing on a star Carry moonbeams home in a jar And be better off than you are Or would you rather be a mule? A mule is an animal with long funny ears Kicks up at anything he hears His back is brawny but his brain is weak He's just plain stupid with a stubborn streak And by the way if you hate to go to school You may grow up to be a mule. Or would you like to swing on a star Carry moonbeams home in a jar And be better off than you are Or would you rather be a pig?. A pig is an animal with dirt on his face His shoes are a terrible disgrace He has no manners when he eats his food He's fat and lazy and extremely rude But if you don't care a feather or a fig You may grow up to be a pig. Or would you like to swing on a star Carry moonbeams home in a jar And be better off than you are Or would you rather be a fish? A fish won't do anything but swim in a brook He can't write his name or read a book To fool the people is his only thought And though he's slippery he still gets caught But then if that sort of life is what you wish You may grow up to be a fish A new kind of jumped-up slippery fish. And all the monkeys aren't in the zoo Every day you meet quite a few So you see it's all up to you You can be better than you are You could be swingin' on a star 
1944,Judy Garland,Trolley Song,With my high starched-collar and my high-topped shoes And my hair piled high upon my head I went to lose a jolly hour on the trolley And lost my heart instead. With his light brown derby and his bright green tie He was quite the handsomest of men. I started to yen so I counted to ten Then I counted to ten again. Clang clang clang went the trolley Ding ding ding went the bell Zing zing zing went my heart strings From the moment I saw him I fell. Chug chug chug went the motor b__p b__p b__p went the brake Thump thump thump went my heart strings When he smiled I could feel the car shake. He tipped his hat and took a seat. He said he hoped he hadn't stepped upon my feet. He asked my name I held my breath. I couldn't speak because he scared me half to death.. Chug chug chug went the motor Pop pop pop went the wheels Stop stop stop went my heart strings As he started to go then I started to know how it feels When the universe reels. The day was bright the air was sweet The smell of honeysuckle charmed you off your feet. You tried to sing but couldn't squeak In fact you loved him so you couldn't even speak.. Buzz buzz buzz went the buzzer Plop plop plop went the wheels Stop stop stop went my heart strings As he started to leave I took hold of his sleeve with my hand And as if it were planned He stayed on with me and it was grand just to stand With his hand holding mine to the end of the line. 
1944,Jimmy Dorsey,Besame Mucho,Besame besame mucho Each time I cling to your kiss I hear music divine Besame mucho Hold me my darling and say that you'll always be mine This joy is something new My arms enfolding you Never knew this thrill before Whoever thought I'd be Holding you close to me Whispering 'It's you I adore' Dearest one If you should leave me Each little dream would take wing and my life would be through Bsame mucho Love me forever and make all my dreams come true. Besame besame mucho Como si fuera esta noche la ltima vez Bsame mucho Que tengo miedo perderte perderte otra vez Quiero tenerte muy Cerca mirarme en tus Ojos verte junto a m Piensa que tal vez Maana yo ya estar Lejos muy lejos de ti Besame bsame mucho Como si fuera esta noche la ltima vez Besame mucho Que tengo miedo perderte perderte despus

1945,Perry Como,Till The End Of Time,Till the end of time long as stars are in the blue Long as there's a Spring of birds to sing I'll go on loving you Till the end of time long as roses bloom in May My love for you will grow deeper with every passing day Till the wells run dry and each mountain disappears I'll be there for you to care for you through laughter and through tears So take my heart in sweet surrender and tenderly say that I'm The one you love and live for till the end of time.

1946,Perry Como,Prisoner Of Love,Alone from night to night you'll find me Too weak to break the chains that bind me I need no shackles to remind me I'm just a prisoner of love For one command I stand and wait now From one who's master of my fate now I can't escape for it's too late now I'm just a prisoner of love. What's the good of my caring if someone is sharing those arms with me? Although she has another I can't have another; for I'm not free. [Chorus] She's in my dreams awake or sleeping Upon my knees to her I'm creeping My very life is in her keeping I'm just a prisoner of love.

1946,Eddy Howard,To Each His Own,A rose must remain with the sun and the rain Or its lovely promise won't come true To each his own to each his own And my own is you What good is a song if the words just don't belong? And a dream must be a dream for two No good alone to each his own For me there's you. If a flame is to grow there must be a glow To open each door there's a key I need you I know I can't let you go Your touch means too much to me. Two lips must insist on two more to be kissed Or they'll never know what love can do To each his own I've found my own One and only you. A rose must remain with the sun and the rain Or its lovely promise won't come true To each his own I've found my own One and only you...

1949,Vaughn Monroe,Riders In The Sky,An old cowpoke went riding out one dark and windy day Upon a ridge he rested as he went along his way When all at once a mighty herd of red-eyed cows he saw A'plowin' through the ragged skies and up a cloudy draw  Yi-pi-yi-ay Yi-pi-yi-o Ghost riders in the sky.  Their brands were still on fire and their hooves were made of steel Their horns wuz black and shiny and their hot breaths he could feel A bolt of fear went through him as they thundered through the sky For he saw the riders comin' hard and he heard their mournful cry.  Yi-pi-yi-ay Yi-pi-yi-o Ghost riders in the sky.  Their faces gaunt their eyes were blurred and shirts all soaked with sweat They're ridin' hard to catch that herd but they ain't caught them yet They've got to ride forever in that range up in the sky On horses snortin' fire as they ride on hear their cry.  Yi-pi-yi-ay Yi-pi-yi-o Ghost riders in the sky  As the riders loped on by him he heard one call his name 'If you want to save your soul from hell a' ridin' on our range' 'Then cowboy change your ways today or with us you will ride' 'A-tryin' to catch the Devil's herd across these endless skies.'.

And then she said 'I got some news this mornin' from Choctaw Ridge Today Billy Joe MacAllister jumped off the Tallahatchie Bridge.' And papa said to mama as he passed around the blackeyed peas 'Well Billy Joe never had a lick of sense; pass the biscuits please There's five more acres in the lower forty I've got to plow.' And mama said it was shame about Billy Joe anyhow Seems like nothin' ever comes to no good up on Choctaw Ridge And now Billy Joe MacAllister's jumped off the Tallahatchie Bridge. And brother said he recollected when he and Tom and Billie Joe Put a frog down my back at the Carroll County picture show And wasn't I talkin' to him after church last Sunday night? 'I'll have another piece-a apple pie; you know it don't seem right I saw him at the sawmill yesterday on Choctaw Ridge And now ya tell me Billie Joe's jumped off the Tallahatchie Bridge.'. And mama said to me 'Child what's happened to your appetite? I've been cookin' all morning and you haven't touched a single bite That nice young preacher Brother Taylor dropped by today Said he'd be pleased to have dinner on Sunday oh by the way He said he saw a girl that looked a lot like you up on Choctaw Ridge And she and Billy Joe was throwing somethin' off the Tallahatchie Bridge.' A year has come and gone since we heard the news 'bout Billy Joe And brother married Becky Thompson; they bought a store in Tupelo There was a virus going 'round; papa caught it and he died last spring And now mama doesn't seem to want to do much of anything And me - I spend a lot of time pickin' flowers up on Choctaw Ridge And drop them into the muddy water off the Tallahatchie Bridge.

And honey I miss you And I'm bein' good And I'd love to be with you If only I could. She wrecked the car and she was sad And so afraid that I'd be mad But what the heck Though I pretended hard to be Guess you could say she saw through me And hugged my neck I came home unexpectedly And caught her cryin' needlessly In the middle of the day And it was in the early Spring When flowers bloom and robins sing She went away. And honey I miss you And I'm bein' good And I'd love to be with you If only I could One day while I was not at home While she was there and all alone The angels came Now all I have is memories of Honey And I wake up nights and call her name Now my life's an empty stage Where Honey lived and Honey played And love grew up And a small cloud passes overhead And cries down on the flower bed That Honey loved. And see the tree how big it's grown But friend it hasn't been too long It wasn't big And I laughed at her and she got mad The first day that she planted it was just a twig.

1971,Rod Steward,Maggie May / (Find A) Reason To Believe,Wake up Maggie I think I got something to say to you. It's late September and I really should be back at school. I know I keep you amused But I feel I'm being used. Oh Maggie I couldn't have tried any more. You led me away from home Just to save you from being alone. You stole my heart and that's what really hurts.. The morning sun when it's in your face Really shows your age. But that don't worry me none. In my eyes you're everything. I laughed at all of your jokes. My love you didn't need to coax. Oh Maggie I couldn't have tried any more. You led me away from home Just to save you from being alone. You stole my soul and that's a pain I can do without.. All I needed was a friend To lend a guiding hand. But you turned into a lover and mother what a lover! You wore me out. All you did was wreck my bed And in the morning kick me in the head Oh Maggie I couldn't have tried any more. You led me away from home 'Cause you didn't want to be alone. You stole my heart. I couldn't leave you if I tried. I suppose I could collect my books And get on back to school. Or steal my daddy's cue And make a living out of playing pool. Or find myself a rock 'n' roll band That needs a helping hand. Oh Maggie I wish I'd never seen your face. You made a first-class fool out of me. But I'm as blind as a fool can be.. If I listened long enough to you I'd find a way to believe that it's all true Knowing that you lied straight-faced while I cried Still I look to find a reason to believe Someone like you makes it hard to live without somebody else Someone like you makes it easy to give never think about myself. If I gave you time to change my mind I'd find a way just to leave the past behind Knowing that you lied straight-faced while I cried Still I look to find a reason to believe. If I listened long enough to you I'd find a way to believe that it's all true Knowing that you lied straight-faced while I cried Still I look to find a reason to believe. Someone like you makes it hard to live without somebody else Someone like you makes it easy to give never think about myself.

1972,Gilbert O'Sullivan,Alone Again (Naturally),In a little while from now If I'm not feeling any less sour I promise myself to treat myself And visit a nearby tower And climbing to the top Will throw myself off In an effort to Make it clear to whoever Wants to know what it's like When you're shattered Left standing in the lurch at a church Were people saying My God that's tough She stood him up No point in us remaining We may as well go home As I did on my own Alone again naturally. To think that only yesterday I was cheerful bright and gay Looking forward to who wouldn't do The role I was about to play But as if to knock me down Reality came around And without so much as a mere touch Cut me into little pieces Leaving me to doubt Talk about God in His mercy Oh if he really does exist Why did he desert me In my hour of need I truly am indeed Alone again naturally. It seems to me that there are more hearts Broken in the world that can't be mended Left unattended What do we do What do we do Alone again naturally. Looking back over the years And whatever else that appears I remember I cried when my father died Never wishing to hide the tears And at sixty-five years old My mother God rest her soul Couldn't understand why the only man She had ever loved had been taken Leaving her to start With a heart so badly broken Despite encouragement from me No words were ever [Spoken] And when she passed away I cried and cried all day Alone again naturally Alone again naturally. 
1972,Don McLean,American Pie,A long long time ago I can still remember how That music used to make me smile And I knew if I had my chance That I could make those people dance And maybe they'd be happy for a while But February made me shiver With every paper I'd deliver Bad news on the doorstep I couldn't take one more step I can't remember if I cried When I read about his widowed bride But something touched me deep inside **The day the music died** So. [Chorus] Bye bye Miss American Pie Drove my Chevy to the levee but the levee was dry Them good ole boys were drinking whiskey in Rye Singin' this'll be the day that I die This'll be the day that I die. Did you write the book of love And do you have faith in God above If the Bible tells you so? Now do you believe in rock and roll? Can music save your mortal soul? And can you teach me how to dance real slow?. Well I know that you're in love with him Cause I saw you dancin' in the gym You both kicked off your shoes Man I dig those rhythm and blues I was a lonely teenage broncin' buck With a pink carnation and a pickup truck But I knew I was out of luck The day the music died I started singin'. [Chorus]. Now for ten years we've been on our own And moss grows fat on a rolling stone But that's not how it used to be When the jester sang for the king and queen In a coat he borrowed from James Dean And a voice that came from you and me Oh and while the king was looking down The jester stole his thorny crown The courtroom was adjourned No verdict was returned And while Lenin read a book on Marx The quartet practiced in the park And we sang dirges in the dark The day the music died We were singin'. [Chorus]. Helter skelter in a summer swelter The birds flew off with a fallout shelter Eight miles high and falling fast It landed foul on the grass The players tried for a forward pass With the jester on the sidelines in a cast Now the half-time air was sweet perfume While sergeants played a marching tune We all got up to dance Oh but we never got the chance Cause the players tried to take the field The marching band refused to yield Do you recall what was revealed The day the music died? We started singin' [Chorus]. Oh and there we were all in one place A generation lost in s___e With no time left to start again So come on Jack be nimble Jack be quick Jack Flash sat on a candlestick Cause fire is the devil's only friend And as I watched him on the stage My hands were clenched in fists of rage No angel born in Hell Could break that Satan's spell And as the flames climbed high into the night To light the sacrificial right I saw Satan laughing with delight The day the music died He was singin'. [Chorus]. I met a girl who sang the blues And I asked her for some happy news But she just smiled and turned away I went down to the sacred store Where I'd heard the music years before But the man there said the music wouldn't play And in the streets the children screamed The lovers cried and the poets dreamed But not a word was spoken The church bells all were broken And the three men I admire most- the Father Son and the Holy Ghost- They caught the last train for the coast The day the music died And they were singing.  
1973,Tony Orlando And Dawn,Tie A Yellow Ribbon Round The Ole Oak Tree,I'm comin' home I've done my time Now I've got to know what is and isn't mine If you received my letter telling you I'd soon be free Then you'll know just what to do If you still want me If you still want me Whoa tie a yellow ribbon 'round the old oak tree It's been three long years Do you still want me?

1973,Jim Croce,Bad Bad Leroy Brown,Well the South side of Chicago Is the baddest part of town And if you go down there You better just beware Of a man named Leroy Brown Now Leroy more than trouble You see he stand 'bout six foot four All the downtown ladies call him 'Treetop Lover' All the men just call him 'Sir'.

Well the two men took to fighting And when they pulled them off the floor Leroy looked like a jigsaw puzzle With a couple of pieces gone

1974,Barbra Streisand,The Way We Were,Mem'ries light the corners of my mind Misty water-colored mem'ries of the way we were. Scattered pictures of the smiles we left behind Smiles we gave to one another for the way we were. Can it be that it was all so simple then Or has time rewritten every line If we had the chance to do it all again tell me would we could we. Mem'ries may be beautiful and yet What's too painful to remember we simply choose to forget So it's the laughter we will remember Whenever we remember the way we were.. The way we were..

I should have known better than to cheat a friend And waste a chance that I'd been given. So I'm never gonna dance again The way I danced with you.. Time can never mend The careless whisper of a good friend. To the heart and mind If your answer's kind... There's no comfort in the truth Pain is all you'll find.. REPEAT CHORUS. What am I without your love? Tonite the music seems so loud I wish that we could lose this crowd. Maybe it's better this way We'd hurt each other with the things we want to say.. We could have been so good together We could have lived this dance forever... But now who's gonna dance with me? Please stay. (Alternatively): And now it's never gonna be That way... REPEAT CHORUS. Now that you're gone... Now that you're gone... Now that you're gone... Was what I did so wrong? So wrong that you had to leave me alone?

Yeah it does I listen to your favorite song Playing on the radio Hear the DJ say love's a game of Easy come and easy go But I wonder does he know Has it ever felt like this And I know that you'd be here right now If I could have let you know somehow I guess. [Chorus] Though it's been a while now I can still feel so much pain Like the knife that cuts you The wound heals but the scar that scar remains I know I could have saved our love that night If I'd known what to say Instead if making love We both made our separate ways Now I hear you've found somebody new And that I never meant that much to you To hear that tears me up inside And to see you cuts me like a knife.

1997,Elton John,Candle In THe Wind 1997,Goodbye England's rose May you ever grow in our hearts You were the grace that placed itself Where lives were torn apart You called out to our country And you whispered to those in pain Now you belong to heaven And the stars spell out your name And it seems to me you lived your life Like a candle in the wind Never fading with the sunset When the rain set in And your footsteps will always fall here Along England's greenest hills Your candle's burned out long before Your legend ever will. Loveliness we've lost These empty days without your smile This torch we'll always carry For our nation's golden child And even though we try The truth brings us to tears All our words cannot express The joy you brought us through the years. And it seems to me you lived your life Like a candle in the wind Never fading with the sunset When the rain set in And your footsteps will always fall here Along England's greenest hills Your candle's burned our long before Your legend ever will Goodbye England's rose May you ever grow in our hearts You were the grace that placed itself Where lives were torn apart Goodbye England's rose From a country lost without your soul Who'll miss the wings of your compassion More than you'll ever know. And it seems to me you lived your life Like a candle in the wind Never fading with the sunset When the rain set in And you footsteps will always fall here Along England's greenest hills Your candle's burned out long before Your legend ever will.  
1997,Jewel,Foolish Games / You Were Meant For Me,You took your coat off and stood in the rain You were always crazy like that I watched from my window Always felt I was outside looking in on you You were always the mysterious one With dark eyes and careless hair You were fashionably sensitive but too cool to care Then you stood in my doorway with nothing to say Besides some comment on the weather Well in case you failed to notice In case you failed to see This is my heart bleeding before you This is me down on my knees. [Chorus] These foolish games are tearing me apart You thoughtless words are breaking my heart You're breaking my heart. You were always brilliant in the morning Smoking your cigarettes talking over coffee You philosophies on art Baroque moved you You loved Mozart and you'd speak of your loved ones As I clumsily strummed my guitar You'd teach me of honest things Things that were daring things that were clean Things that knew what an honest dollar did mean So I hid my soiled hands behind my back Somewhere along the line I must've gone off track with you Excuse me think I've mistaken you for somebody else Somebody who gave a d___ Somebody more like myself [Chorus]. You took off your coat and stood in the rain You were always like that. I hear the clock it's 6 a.m. I feel so far away from where I've been I got my eggs and my pancakes too I got my maple syrup everything but you I break the yolks and make a smiley face I kinda like it in my brand new place I wipe the spots off of the mirror Don't leave the keys in the door I never put wet towels on the floor anymore 'cause. [Chorus] Dreams last so long even after you're gone I know you love me And soon you will see you were meant for me And I was meant for you. I called my momma she was out for a walk Consoled a cup of coffee but it didn't want to talk So I picked up a paper it was more bad news More hearts being broken or people being used Put on my coat in the pouring rain I saw a movie it just wasn't the same Cause it was happy and I was sad It made me miss you oh so bad. [Chorus]. I go about my business I'm doing fine Besides what would I say if I had you on the line Same old story not much to say Hearts are broken every day I brush my teeth and put the cap back on I know you hate it when I leave the light on I pick up a book and turn the sheets down And take a deep breath and a good look around. Put on my pj's and hop into bed I'm half alive but I feel mostly dead I try and tell myself it'll be all right I just shouldn't think anymore tonight. [Chorus]. You were meant for me and I was meant for you.

2004,Alicia Keys,If I Ain't Got You,Some people live for the fortune Some people live just for the fame Some people live for the power Some people live just to play the game Some people think that the physical things define what's within And I have been there before and that life's a bore So full of the superficial. Some people want it all But I don't want nothing at all If it ain't you baby If I ain't got you baby Some people want diamond rings Some just want everything But everything means nothing If I ain't got you. Some people search for a fountain That promises forever young Some people need three dozen roses And that's the only way to prove you love them. Hand me the world on a silver platter And what good would it be With no one to share with no one who truly cares for me. Some people want it all But I don't want nothing at all If it ain't you baby If I ain't got you baby Some people want diamond rings Some just want everything But everything means nothing If I ain't got you Some people want it all But I don't want nothing at all If it ain't you baby If I ain't got you baby Some people want diamond rings Some just want everything But everything means nothing If I ain't got you. If I ain't got you with me baby Nothing in this whole wide world don't mean a thing If I ain't got you with me baby.

Who else am I gon' lean on When times get rough Who's gonna talk to me on the phone Till the sun comes up Who's gonna take your place There ain't nobody better Oh baby baby we belong together. I can't sleep at night When you are on my mind Bobby Womack's on the radio Saying to me 'If you think you're lonely now' Wait a minute This is too deep (too deep) I gotta change the station So I turn the dial Trying to catch a break And then I hear Babyface I only think of you And it's breaking my heart I'm trying to keep it together But I'm falling apart. I'm feeling all out of my element I'm throwing things crying Trying to figure out Where the hell I went wrong The pain reflected in this song It ain't even half of what I'm feeling inside I need you Need you back in my life baby [Chorus]. Who else am I gon' lean on When times get rough Who's gonna talk to me on the phone Till the sun comes up Who's gonna take your place There ain't nobody better Oh baby baby we belong together baby.

2008,Leona Lewis,Bleeding Love,Closed off from love I didn't need the pain Once or twice was enough And it was all in vain Time starts to pass Before you know it you're frozen But something happened For the very first time with you My heart melts into the ground Found something true And everyone's looking round Thinking I'm going crazy. But I don't care what they say I'm in love with you They try to pull me away But they don't know the truth My heart's crippled by the vein That I keep on closing You cut me open and I. Keep bleeding Keep keep bleeding love I keep bleeding I keep keep bleeding love Keep bleeding Keep keep bleeding love You cut me open. Trying hard not to hear But they talk so loud Their piercing sounds fill my ears Try to fill me with doubt Yet I know that the goal Is to keep me from falling. But nothing's greater Than the rush that comes with your embrace And in this world of loneliness I see your face Yet everyone around me Thinks that I'm going crazy maybe maybe. But I don't care what they say I'm in love with you They try to pull me away But they don't know the truth My heart's crippled by the vein That I keep on closing You cut me open and I. Keep bleeding Keep keep bleeding love I keep bleeding I keep keep bleeding love Keep bleeding Keep keep bleeding love You cut me open And it's draining all of me Oh they find it hard to believe I'll be wearing these scars For everyone to see. I don't care what they say I'm in love with you They try to pull me away But they don't know the truth My heart's crippled by the vein That I keep on closing You cut me open and I. Keep bleeding Keep keep bleeding love I keep bleeding I keep keep bleeding love Keep bleeding Keep keep bleeding love You cut me open and I. Keep bleeding Keep keep bleeding love I keep bleeding I keep keep bleeding love Keep bleeding Keep keep bleeding love You cut me open and I Keep bleeding Keep keep bleeding love

You're gonna leave 'em all in awe-awe-awe. Boom boom boom Even brighter than the moon moon moon Boom boom boom Even brighter than the moon moon moon. 
2012,Gotye,Somebody That I Used To Know,Now and then I think of when we were together Like when you said you felt so happy you could die Told myself that you were right for me But felt so lonely in your company But that was love and it's an ache I still remember You can get addicted to a certain kind of sadness Like resignation to the end Always the end So when we found that we could not make sense Well you said that we would still be friends But I'll admit that I was glad that it was over. But you didn't have to cut me off Make out like it never happened And that we were nothing And I don't even need your love But you treat me like a stranger And that feels so rough You didn't have to stoop so low Have your friends collect your records And then change your number I guess that I don't need that though Now you're just somebody that I used to know. Now and then I think of all the times you screwed me over But had me believing it was always something that I'd done And I don't wanna live that way Reading into every word you say You said that you could let it go And I wouldn't catch you hung up on somebody that you used to know.... But you didn't have to cut me off Make out like it never happened And that we were nothing And I don't even need your love But you treat me like a stranger And that feels so rough You didn't have to stoop so low Have your friends collect your records And then change your number I guess that I don't need that though Now you're just somebody that I used to know I used to know That I used to know. Somebody.
